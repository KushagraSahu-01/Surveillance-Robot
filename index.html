<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p> Robots are essentially a self-contained tribute to the wonders of technology.
The most advanced models use fast computer processing, high-definition cameras,
artificial intelligence and long-range sensors,
all of which give you a pretty good idea where technology is heading.
<br>
<br>
An autonomous mobile robot is a type of robot that can understand and navigate an environment 
independently.
They use a sophisticated system of sensors, AI, 
and Machine Learning to plan routes and interpret the best option, 
without relying on electrical wires or predefined paths. 
This new generation of robots is equipped with cameras and sensors, 
so they can dodge obstacles while navigating, employing navigation techniques to slow down, 
stop or recalculate the route without collisions.
<br>
<br>
For many security professionals,
most of their work is spent monitoring and patrolling.
It is therefore a major effort in time investment,
especially when dealing with very large areas.
<br>
<br>
Intelligent security robotics can identify problems that may go unnoticed by humans,
tracking people and assets, patrolling physical areas, or recording data.
Plus, they never sleep.
