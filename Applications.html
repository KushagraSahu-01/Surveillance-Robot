<h1>Applications of Surveillance Robots</h1>
<h2>Robots Can Guard a Designated Area</h2>
<p>To stay within an area, we can use mapping software to create a geo-fenced perimeter.
The robots then moves autonomously (up to 3 miles per hour) 
and detects objects using two Light Detection and Ranging sensors.
The robo creates a point cloud,
such as a 3-D image of the surroundings showing the objects within the geo-fenced area.
the robots use a differential GPS that finds objects within a few centimeters.
That helps the robot know exactly where it's moving at all times. 
There's also an ultrasonic sensor for detecting objects close to the robot.
</p>
<h2>Robots Can Monitor the Grounds</h2>
<p>If a we deploys an Surveillance robot in a parking lot, 
one primary function is recording suspicious activity.
To help, four HD video cameras can monitor and record in a 360-degree circle around the robot.
Crucially, the robot doesn't just mindlessly record activity.
If there's a trigger, such as unusual or sudden movement, 
the robot will record a video clip,
stamp it with the GPS coordinates and alert the security guards.
</p>
<h2>Robots Can Listen to Social Media Chatter</h2>
<p>One interesting feature on some robots is the capability to compare real-time events detected 
with video cameras and motion sensors with social media chatter.
The robots can “listen” for hashtags,keywords and other information 
and compare it to nearby objects and video feeds in a given area.
<br>
<br>
For example, if the robot patrols a parking lot late at night and detects a moving car, 
the robot can search Twitter for reports of a stolen car.
