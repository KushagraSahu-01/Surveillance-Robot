<h1>Benefits of Using a Surveillance Robot</h1>
<img src="benefits-drone.jpg" alt="Surveillance robot" style="max-width: 600px;">
<h2>Mobility and Flexibility</h2>
<p>Autonomous security robots have the ability to move in complex environments,
detecting and reporting anomalies in the environment.
Their sensors and cameras allow them not to lose their balance,
even when moving through complex terrain. With improvements in 5G networks,
robots can traverse even larger and more complex areas.</p>
<h2>Cost-Effectiveness</h2>
<p>These automated robots are the perfect choice for organizations that need an acceleration 
of their security operations and want to invest in a device that can be more cost-effective 
in doing a task that is too time-consuming and exhaustive.</p>
<h2>Reduced Worker Exposure to Danger</h2>
<p>This may seem like the most obvious benefit, and it is.
You exponentially reduce the exposure of human capital to 
hazards that pose a significant risk of injury or death.
You move from a traditional method of light curtains or safety 
controllers to a no-contact environment.</p>
<h2>Continuous Work</h2>
<p>Unlike safety professionals, 
autonomous robots do not suffer from stress or fatigue and can work for longer periods of time. 
This makes them the perfect backup in cases of human error. Surveillance is ensured 24/7, 
with minimal need for human intervention.</p>
<h2>Enhanced Workforce</h2>
<p>Security robots can help enhance the capabilities of security professionals.
Far from replacing them, they can help them with other more boring and time-consuming tasks,
so they can focus on more important tasks.</p>
